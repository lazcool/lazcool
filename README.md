# Project highlights

## Amiga O/S

I started out at [Optonica](https://ia600209.us.archive.org/8/items/Cam_1-12_FullVersion/Cam_1-12_FullVersion/issue02/page04.html) (later ANQ), who were [subcontracted out to work on the Amiga O/S](http://www.bambi-amiga.co.uk/amigahistory/amigaed.html). I worked on adding support for various video and image formats to the [Datatypes library](https://wiki.amigaos.net/wiki/Datatypes_Library) in the Amiga O/S, and also writing a multimedia file converter, mentioned in this [magazine](https://ia903207.us.archive.org/25/items/Amiga_CD32_Gamer_Issue_12_1995-05_Paragon_Publishing_GB/Amiga_CD32_Gamer_Issue_12_1995-05_Paragon_Publishing_GB.pdf) at the time, where I get a namecheck!

## TOCA 2 Touring Cars

Whilst working at CodeMasters, I worked on [TOCA 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TOCA_2_Touring_Cars), which reached #1 in the UK charts.

## EPOC O/S

Whilst contracting at Psion, I worked on adapting the EPOC (later Symbian) operating system to work on a couple of different handheld machines, the [netPad](http://www.ruggedpcreview.com/3_handhelds_psion_netpad.html) and the PowerPad (which was a custom handheld made for FedEx).
